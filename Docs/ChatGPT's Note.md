# 🤖 ChatGPT Code Contribution

This project includes code components generated by ChatGPT as part of a collaborative human–AI development process.
The AI contribution focused on **system architecture, automation logic, data analytics pipelines, and structural integration**.

### Core AI Contributions

ChatGPT generated and integrated:

### 📦 Data Processing Architecture

* Recursive JSON parsing for ChatGPT export format (`mapping → message → children`)
* Robust timestamp normalization
* Role-based message classification (user/assistant/system)
* Content extraction from mixed `parts` structures

### 📊 Analytical Pipelines

* Tokenization (`tiktoken` integration)
* Word and token counting
* Sentiment analysis (TextBlob)
* Entropy computation (Shannon entropy)
* Lexical diversity metrics
* Readability scoring (Flesch-based approximation)
* Dialogue act classification
* Topic clustering simulation layer
* Topic drift modeling
* Keyword flow graph logic
* Flow edge detection
* Sentiment shift modeling
* Response revision detection (edit similarity via `SequenceMatcher`)
* Structural complexity modeling:

  * elaboration detection
  * contradiction detection
  * complexity ratio computation

### 📐 Statistical Modeling

* Response-time analytics
* Median response time
* Mean response time
* Interquartile Range (IQR) filtering
* Outlier-resistant response modeling
* Role-specific metrics (user vs assistant)

### 📑 Data Export Systems

* Multi-sheet Excel generation
* Thread-level analytics sheets
* Global summary sheet
* Cross-sheet hyperlinking system
* Bi-directional navigation (thread ↔ summary)
* Header formatting
* Column freezing
* Structured metadata embedding

### 🧠 Research-Oriented Design

* Metric modularization
* Reusable function architecture
* Research-grade extensibility
* Format-agnostic JSON adaptability
* Separation of extraction, analysis, modeling, and export layers

> ChatGPT’s role in this project was not limited to code generation, but included **systems thinking, pipeline design, data modeling strategy, and structural optimization**, functioning as a computational co-designer rather than a simple code generator.
