## ORIGINS AND MOTIVATION

### The Problem Observed

Early 2020s: Widespread availability of capable AI systems (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) enabled independent developers to create sophisticated tools rapidly. However, existing open-source licenses failed to protect these tools from capture:

| License Type | Failure Mode |
|-------------|--------------|
| Permissive (MIT, Apache) | Allowed commercial enclosure, "Enterprise Editions" |
| Copyleft (GPL) | Allowed commercial sale, support monetization |
| Non-commercial (CC BY-NC) | Prohibited legitimate commercial use, preventing adoption |
| Ethical source | Targeted specific harms, not structural enclosure |

### The Response

RCNM designed to fill this gap: permit commercial **use** while prohibiting commercial **sale**; ensure temporal persistence; protect against AI-output patent claims; enable distributed custody.

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES (v1.0)

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Abundance over scarcity | Non-monetization of AI-assisted creation |
| Use over sale | Commercial use permitted, commercial sale prohibited |
| Persistence over popularity | Irrevocability, posthumous binding |
| Distributed sovereignty | Orphan mechanism, structural fixation |
| Reciprocal AI fairness | Fair Use Shield |
| Honest scope | Declaration acknowledges limitations |

---

## KEY PROVISIONS (v1.0)

### Temporal Architecture
- Irrevocability (Section 4.2)
- Posthumous binding (Section 4.3)
- 15-day deactivation delay (Section 4.6)

### Anti-Capture Mechanisms
- Logical and architectural protection (Section 5)
- Parent-child independence (Section 10)
- Structural fixation (Section 11)
- Instantaneous orphan mechanism (Section 10.2)

### AI-Specific Protections
- AI Fair Use Shield (Section 12)
- Conditional Consent Doctrine (Section 17.11)

### Governance
- Community enforcement prioritized (Section 14)
- Public interest override (Section 9)

---

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS (v1.0)

| Limitation | Acknowledgment |
|-----------|---------------|
| No judicial precedent | Untested in court |
| Novel provisions may fail | Orphan mechanism, structural fixation are experimental |
| Corporate legal departments may reject | Non-standard license |
| Determined actors can bypass | Independent reimplementation not prevented |
| Jurisdictional variation | Moral rights, posthumous binding vary by country |

Documented fully in [LICENSE-FULL.md Section 18](LICENSE-FULL.md) and [DECLARATION.md](DECLARATION.md).

## FUTURE VERSIONS (ANTICIPATED)

### v1.1 (Potential)
| Area | Possible refinement |
|------|-------------------|
| Temporal anchoring | Clarification of timestamp requirements |
| Child registration | Streamlined process for orphan activation |
| AI Shield | Refinement based on case law developments |
| Appendices | Expansion of implementation guidance |

### v2.0 (Potential)
| Area | Possible major change |
|------|---------------------|
| Institutional governance | Optional foundation structure |
| International harmonization | Jurisdiction-specific modules |
| Technical enforcement | Blockchain integration, smart contracts |

### Migration Path
- v1.0 → v1.1: Automatic, clarifying amendments
- v1.x → v2.0: Requires explicit author action or community fork

---

## VERSIONING PRINCIPLES

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Semantic clarity | Major.minor.patch structure |
| Backward compatibility | Minor versions preserve core obligations |
| Irrevocability respect | Major versions require explicit adoption |
| Community notification | All changes documented publicly |
| Fork permission | Anyone may create derivative license versions |

---

## FORK AND ADAPTATION

RCNM v1.0 explicitly permits:

| Action | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| Create derivative licenses | Must distinguish from RCNM, document modifications |
| Adapt to specific jurisdictions | Must maintain core non-monetization principle |
| Translate to other languages | Must preserve legal meaning |
| Combine with other licenses | Must not weaken RCNM core protections |

See [LICENSE-FULL.md Section 17.3](LICENSE-FULL.md).

---

## HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### Pre-RCNM Attempts

| Attempt | Limitation | RCNM Improvement |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Custom "non-commercial" clauses | Vague, unenforceable | Specific test: "paying for software vs. paying for service" |
| "Ethical source" licenses | Targeted specific harms | Targets structural enclosure |
| Foundation-held copyrights | Single point of failure | Distributed custody, no central authority |
| Informal "please don't sell" requests | No enforcement mechanism | Contractual terms, community governance |

### Parallel Developments (2024-2026)

| Development | Relation to RCNM |
|-------------|------------------|
| AI authorship copyright debates | RCNM acknowledges uncertainty, grants permissions to extent possible |
| Open source sustainability crisis | RCNM addresses capture, not funding |
| Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) | RCNM compatible with DAO governance of projects |
| Blockchain timestamping | RCNM encourages as evidentiary support |

---

## ADOPTION TRACKING (v1.0)

| Metric | Status (as of release) |
|--------|------------------------|
| Projects using RCNM | Initial: ChatGPT-DialogueMetrics |
| Known forks | None |
| Legal challenges | None |
| Judicial interpretation | None |
| Academic analysis | None |

Future versions will track adoption if community forms.

## MIGRATION GUIDANCE

### From Other Licenses

| From | To RCNM | Consideration |
|------|---------|---------------|
| MIT | Possible | Irrevocability prevents future proprietary licensing |
| GPL | Possible | Stricter share-alike, no commercial sale |
| Apache | Possible | Patent clause replaced with AI Fair Use Shield |
| CC0/Public Domain | Not recommended | RCNM imposes conditions, opposite of dedication |
| Proprietary | Possible | Requires all contributor consent |

### To Other Licenses

| From RCNM | To | Possibility |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| v1.0 | v1.1+ | Automatic if clarifying |
| v1.x | v2.0 | Requires explicit author action |
| Any | Permissive (MIT, etc.) | **Impossible** — irrevocability prevents |
| Any | Copyleft (GPL, etc.) | **Impossible** — irrevocability prevents weakening |
| Any | Proprietary | **Impossible** — core principle |

## FINAL NOTE (v1.0)

RCNM v1.0 is a **starting point**, not a destination. It is offered to those who share its hopes, with full acknowledgment of its limitations. If it serves, use it. If you can improve it, do so. If you replace it with something better, you will have honored its purpose.

&gt; The commons does not require perfection. It requires persistence.
