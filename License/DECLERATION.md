# DECLARATION OF HOPE AND INTENT

### 1. WHAT THIS IS

This is not a legal document. It will not bind you in court. It will not prevent those with resources from testing, challenging, or circumventing the license we have built.

This is a statement of why we built it anyway.

---

### 2. THE PROBLEM WE SAW

Independent developers and researchers—those without institutional backing, legal departments, or venture funding—create valuable tools through collaboration with artificial intelligence. These tools are easy to build and easy to steal.

The pattern is familiar:

- A developer publishes something useful
- A corporation extracts it, improves it slightly, paywalls it
- The original withers; the expensive version replaces it
- The developer burns out, moves on, or dies
- The commons loses what it made

We wanted to break this pattern. Not perfectly. Not permanently. But demonstrably.

---

### 3. WHAT WE BUILT

RCNM is a legal experiment. It attempts to:

- Make enclosure unprofitable through contractual and social mechanisms
- Ensure persistence beyond the author through temporal architecture
- Protect independent contributors from capture through parent-child independence
- Assert reciprocal fairness in AI-generated outputs through the Fair Use Shield

It does this by layering uncertainty: legal ambiguity, social norms, technical distribution, and community enforcement. None of these layers is strong alone. Together, they create friction for extraction.

---

### 4. WHAT WE CANNOT DO

We cannot:

- Prevent legal forking of this license
- Stop determined, well-resourced actors from independent reimplementation
- Guarantee judicial enforcement of our most ambitious clauses
- Ensure community cohesion if no community forms
- Promise perpetual technical persistence against platform failure or cryptographic decay

We cannot make you safe. We can only make visible a different way of working.

---

### 5. WHAT WE HOPE FOR

We hope that you—the reader who shares these intuitions—will:

- Use this license as a coordination device with others like you
- Build tools that are genuinely useful, making enclosure costly
- Cultivate communities that value attribution and reciprocity
- Document lineage so that provenance is traceable
- Create visibility so that extraction is noticeable
- Improve this license, or replace it with something better

We hope for distributed persistence: many small commons, each vulnerable alone, but collectively demonstrating that common production is viable.

We hope for stubborn hope: not naive optimism, but persistent commitment to building outside the enclosure economy.

### 6. THE FIGHT

The fight for independent commons is not primarily legal. It is:

| Domain | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Social | Build communities that enforce norms through reputation |
| Technical | Create infrastructure that makes commons coordination easier |
| Cultural | Make enclosure socially costly, commons participation attractive |
| Legal | Use licenses as signals of intent, last resorts for egregious violations |

We cannot fight this for you. We can only offer this tool to those who will fight alongside us.

### 7. FINAL WORD

If you need fortress-level IP protection, consult legal counsel about patents or established licenses. RCNM is not for you.

If you would rather be forgotten than remembered as the founder of a paywalled tool, if you believe abundance should not be enclosed, if you are willing to trade legal certainty for principled commitment—then this license is offered to you.

Not as a solution. As a contribution to a conversation. As a scaffold—temporary, improvable, meant to be built upon and replaced.

The commons does not require perfection. It requires many hands. It requires persistence. It requires hope that is stubborn.

This is our stubborn hope.
