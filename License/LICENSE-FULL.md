## 1. PREAMBLE AND DECLARATION OF INTENT

The Research Commons Non-Monetization License (RCNM) Version 1.0 is a purpose-built legal instrument designed for a specific category of intellectual production: works created through substantial collaboration between human authors and artificial intelligence systems. This license represents a deliberate departure from traditional intellectual property frameworks, which were conceived for an era of scarcity in creative production and individual authorship.

The author of this license, R.Rex, declares the following intents:

**Primary Intent**: To prevent the enclosure of AI-assisted intellectual tools by institutional actors—commercial or academic—through the creation of a legally and socially enforceable commons.

**Secondary Intent**: To ensure that works published under this license persist beyond the mortality, burnout, or compromise of the original author, remaining accessible to independent researchers and developers regardless of institutional power or economic resources.

**Tertiary Intent**: To provide a bridge between modest originators and significant contributors, ensuring that labor invested in commons-based projects is protected from extraction and privatization.

**Quaternary Intent**: To establish legal parity between AI model holders and users, preventing retroactive proprietary claims over outputs generated through public AI access.

**Refusal of Intent**: This license explicitly refuses to establish precedent for traditional human-created works (literature, art, music, manually crafted software) where labor theories of value and individual authorship remain salient. It applies exclusively to the emerging category of AI-assisted production, where traditional justifications for intellectual property have been destabilized.

This license is offered not as a universal standard but as a voluntary alignment mechanism for authors who share these specific principles. Others may adopt, adapt, or ignore this license at their discretion. No enforcement is claimed over works not explicitly placed under RCNM by their authors.

---

## 2. DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETIVE FRAMEWORK

For the purposes of this license and its interpretation, the following terms shall have the meanings specified below:

**"Software"**: The work of authorship made available under this license, including source code, object code, documentation, design specifications, and associated materials. In the context of AI-assisted works, "Software" includes prompts, training configurations, and methodological documentation that constitute the human contribution to the collaborative production process.

**"Author"**: The human individual who has made the creative decisions of selection, curation, prompting, and integration necessary to produce the Software through collaboration with AI systems. The Author acknowledges that copyright status of AI-generated content may be uncertain under current law; to the extent any copyright exists, it is held by the named human Author.

**"AI Systems"**: Artificial intelligence models, tools, or platforms used in the creation of the Software, including but not limited to large language models, code generation systems, and automated design tools. The specific AI systems used in the creation of this Software are documented as: ChatGPT, Claude, Kimi, DeepSeek, and Gemini.

**"User"**: Any person, organization, or entity obtaining a copy of the Software under the terms of this license.

**"Modification"**: Any alteration, adaptation, translation, or transformation of the Software, including integration into larger works, architectural reimplementation, or logical derivation.

**"Distribution"**: The act of making the Software available to others, whether through publication, transfer, network dissemination, or any other means of making copies accessible.

**"Monetization"**: The direct or indirect extraction of economic value from access to the Software itself, including but not limited to: sale of the Software, placement behind paywalls, requirement of payment for download or use, bundling as a primary selling point of commercial products, or integration into services where the Software constitutes the core value proposition.

**"Institutional Capture"**: The process by which corporate, academic, or other organizational actors assume control over a work originally created by independent authors, typically through acquisition of rights, employment of the author, or creation of proprietary derivatives that supplant the original commons-based version.

**"Logical Structure"**: The underlying methodology, algorithmic approach, data flow architecture, and systematic organization of the Software, distinct from its specific expression in code. This includes but is not limited to: the conceptual framework for analysis, the sequence of operations, the relationships between components, and the innovative methodological choices embedded in the design.

**"Architectural Design"**: The high-level organization of the Software, including module relationships, interface definitions, data structures, and system topology, considered as a coherent design independent of implementation details.

**"Independent Developer"**: A natural person creating software without institutional employment or backing for the specific project, or a loosely affiliated collective of such persons operating without hierarchical organizational structure.

**"Significant Contributor"**: A User who makes substantive Modifications to the Software that constitute original creative labor, as distinguished from minor bug fixes, cosmetic changes, or routine maintenance.

**"Commons"**: The shared resource space in which the Software exists, characterized by free access, non-exclusive use rights, and prohibition of enclosure or privatization.

**"Child Repository"**: Any derivative project, fork, substantial modification, or reimplementation that incorporates code, logic, or architecture from the Parent Repository, is distributed or made publicly available, and constitutes a distinct project with its own maintenance.

**"Parent Repository"**: The original repository from which a Child Repository derives, maintaining the root lineage of the RCNM ecosystem.

**"Orphan Status"**: The condition of a Child Repository that has achieved independence from the Parent under Section 10, operating under self-governing RCNM terms without a living parent license authority.

**"Base Structure"**: All files, code, logic, architecture, and design elements retained unmodified or minimally modified from the Parent Repository in a Child Repository.

**"AI Fair Use Shield"**: The protection established in Section 12 preventing retroactive patent or proprietary claims by AI model holders over outputs generated under General Use and Fair Use Policy.

**"General Use and Fair Use Policy"**: Publicly accessible AI interfaces with standard consumer or researcher access tiers, no specialized contractual restrictions beyond standard Terms of Service, and usage consistent with platform stated acceptable use policies.

## 3. ONTOLOGICAL SPECIFICATION: AI-ASSISTED WORKS

### 3.1 Scope of Application

This license applies exclusively to works meeting the following criteria:

**Criterion A - Substantial AI Collaboration**: The creative decisions constituting the Software's structure, logic, and design were generated through interaction with AI systems, such that the work could not have been produced in substantially similar form by the human author alone in comparable time.

**Criterion B - Human Curation**: The human contribution consists primarily of selection, prompting, integration, evaluation, and refinement rather than de novo creation of the implemented content.

**Criterion C - Reproducibility**: The AI-assisted nature of production means the work is, in principle, reproducible—similar prompts and configurations would generate similar outputs, distinguishing it from the irreducible singularity of traditional human creative expression.

### 3.2 Exclusion of Traditional Works

The Author explicitly declares that this license is NOT intended for application to:

- Literary works created through traditional composition
- Musical works composed through manual or performative creation
- Visual arts produced through direct manual execution
- Software coded through line-by-line human programming without AI assistance
- Any work where the scarcity rationale for intellectual property (investment of irreplaceable human time and skill) remains applicable

### 3.3 Philosophical Basis

The restriction to AI-assisted works reflects a specific ontological claim: **the economics of AI-assisted production have severed the link between creative labor and scarcity that traditionally justified intellectual property rights**. When a human can generate, through AI collaboration, in hours what once required years of training and execution, the "desert" basis for exclusive rights evaporates. What remains is the danger of enclosure—rent-seeking on abundant resources—and the need for commons-based governance.

### 3.4 AI Collaboration Under Fair Use

AI systems used in RCNM-licensed works are accessed under General Use and Fair Use Policy. Outputs generated through such access are protected by the AI Fair Use Shield (Section 12), preventing retroactive patent claims by model holders.

---

## 4. TEMPORAL ARCHITECTURE: IRREVOCABILITY AND POSTHUMOUS BINDING

### 4.1 The Problem of Temporal Vulnerability

Traditional open-source licenses suffer from a structural weakness: they bind the work but not the author's future decisions. An author may release work under a permissive license, then—tempted by commercial opportunity, exhausted by maintenance burden, or compromised by institutional pressure—revoke the commons status, sell exclusive rights, or permit proprietary enclosure. Alternatively, the author's death may transfer decision-making to heirs or estates who do not share the author's commitments, leading to posthumous enclosure.

### 4.2 Irrevocability Mechanism

The Author of this license explicitly waives the right to:

- Revoke the license granted herein
- Offer exclusive or proprietary rights to any party
- Dual-license the Software under terms permitting enclosure
- Transfer copyright in ways that would enable license modification

This waiver is binding upon the Author from the moment of publication and survives any subsequent change in the Author's circumstances, including but not limited to: employment by commercial entities, acquisition of institutional backing, personal financial distress, or philosophical reconsideration.

### 4.3 Posthumous Binding

Upon the Author's death, the following provisions take effect:

**Termination of Modification Rights**: All rights to modify, revoke, or replace this license terminate absolutely. The license becomes immutable at its current version.

**Non-Hereditary Principles**: While copyright may transfer to heirs or estates by operation of law, the moral and ethical commitments encoded in this license do not transfer. Heirs and successors in title inherit no authority to alter the terms of distribution, to offer proprietary licenses, or to permit enclosure of the Software.

**Moral Rights Invocation**: The Author invokes any applicable moral rights (droit moral) of integrity to prevent distortion, mutilation, or modification of the work that would violate the principles of non-monetization and commons-based access. In jurisdictions recognizing moral rights, these rights are exercised to preserve the license terms; in jurisdictions not recognizing moral rights, this clause serves as evidence of the Author's intent.

### 4.4 Pre-Death Amendment Window

The Author reserves the limited right to:

- Release subsequent versions of this license (RCNM v2.0, etc.) with clarified or refined terms
- Migrate the Software to a substantially equivalent copyleft license that maintains the core prohibitions on monetization and enclosure

**Conditions for Amendment**:
1. Any amendment must be documented in a signed writing or cryptographically timestamped record dated prior to the Author's death
2. Amendments must apply uniformly to all works under this license, not selectively to specific projects
3. Amendments must not be motivated by external compensation, institutional pressure, or coercion
4. Absent such documented amendment prior to death, this license version remains immutable

### 4.5 Succession Protocol

In the event of the Author's prolonged incapacity or death, the following succession mechanism applies:

**Community Forking Right**: Any User may declare themselves a successor maintainer, provided they:
- Publicly announce their assumption of maintenance responsibilities
- Commit to preserving the license terms without modification
- Maintain public availability of the Software and all modifications

**No Central Authority**: No single entity or person is designated as exclusive successor. The license encourages distributed maintenance through the commons, preventing single points of failure or capture.

### 4.6 Temporal Anchoring and Deactivation Protocol

#### 4.6.1 Timestamp Requirement for License Activation

**Mandatory Inclusion**: The Author must incorporate a **date and time stamp** indicating when the RCNM License was applied to the Software. This timestamp shall take one of the following forms:

- **Explicit Timestamp**: Author-specified date and time in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS), included in the license file header or repository documentation
- **Implicit Timestamp**: If no explicit timestamp is provided, the timestamp of the initial commit containing the LICENSE.md file to the repository shall serve as the baseline of license effectivity
- **Backup Timestamp**: If repository commit history is unavailable or disputed, the earliest archival record (e.g., Internet Archive snapshot, blockchain timestamp, publication record) shall serve as baseline

**Evidentiary Function**: This timestamp establishes:
- The point at which the irrevocability mechanism activates
- The reference point for calculating the 15-day deactivation delay
- The historical record for determining which version of the license applies to specific contributions

#### 4.6.2 Deactivation and License Change Protocol

**Activation of Change**: The Author may initiate deactivation of RCNM or migration to a different license only through:

1. **Signed Writing**: Cryptographically signed statement or legally witnessed document
2. **Public Notification**: Posting to the original repository and all known forks/mirrors
3. **Timestamped Record**: Inclusion of explicit date and time of the change decision

**Mandatory Delay Period**: Upon initiation of deactivation or license change:

- **15-Day Hold Period**: The authority of RCNM remains in full force for **15 days** from the timestamped initiation
- **Continued Protection**: During this period, all provisions (non-monetization, share-alike, logical protection) remain binding
- **Community Notification**: The initiation triggers automatic notification to known contributors and mirrors

#### 4.6.3 Anti-Coercion Safeguard

**Purpose**: The 15-day delay creates a **cooling-off period** to prevent:

- **Hacking**: Unauthorized access to repository forcing license change
- **Systematic Coercion**: Pressure campaigns, threats, or manipulation of author
- **Impulsive Abandonment**: Momentary despair or frustration leading to license stripping
- **Compromised Authority**: Author acting under duress, intoxication, or mental incapacity

**Recovery Mechanism**: During the 15-day delay:

- **Author Revocation of Change**: The Author may withdraw the deactivation notice, restoring permanent RCNM status
- **Community Intervention**: Contributors may contact author to verify intent, offer support, or identify coercion
- **Forking Opportunity**: Community may fork at current RCNM status before any change takes effect

**Finality After Delay**: If the 15-day period expires without revocation:

- The deactivation or license change takes effect
- The work may be re-licensed under terms specified by the Author
- **Irrevocability of New Terms**: Any new license applied is itself subject to its own terms; RCNM does not bind future licensing decisions after valid deactivation
- **Instantaneous Orphan Mechanism**: All Child Repositories immediately achieve independence (Section 10)

#### 4.6.4 Emergency Preservation and Lineage Activation

Upon announcement of deactivation or license change:

**Immediate Forking Right**: Any User may create timestamped fork under continuing RCNM terms

**Lineage Assumption**: Forking User may:
- Assume documentation custody for the forked version
- Establish new registry for Child Repositories of the fork
- Declare themselves successor maintainer for their lineage branch

**Distributed Succession**: Multiple forking Users create multiple lineage branches, each preserving RCNM terms. No single successor has exclusive authority.

## 5. ANTI-CAPTURE MECHANISMS: LOGICAL AND ARCHITECTURAL PROTECTION

### 5.1 Beyond Traditional Copyright

Traditional copyright protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. This creates a vulnerability: an actor may study the Software, understand its innovative logical structure, and reimplement that structure in different code, achieving functional equivalence while evading copyright infringement.

RCNM addresses this through explicit protection of **Logical Structure** and **Architectural Design**, recognizing that in AI-assisted works, the value lies not in the specific code generated (which is abundant and reproducible) but in the methodological and architectural choices made by the human author in collaboration with AI systems.

### 5.2 Scope of Protection

The following are protected from enclosure, whether through direct copying or independent reimplementation:

**Protected Elements**:
- The systematic methodology for analysis, processing, or generation embodied in the Software
- The specific sequence of operations and data transformations
- The modular organization and interface relationships
- The innovative methodological choices documented in design rationale
- The training configurations, prompt engineering, and curation strategies that constitute the human creative contribution

**Prohibited Acts**:
- Reimplementation of the protected logical structure in proprietary software
- Integration of the architectural design into commercial products without public release
- Use of the methodological framework as the foundation for paid services where the methodology itself is the primary value
- "Clean room" reconstruction of the Software's architecture for commercial purposes

### 5.3 Defensive Documentation

To support enforcement of logical and architectural protection, Authors are encouraged to maintain:

**Design Rationale Documentation**: Explicit statements of why specific architectural choices were made, what alternatives were rejected, and what problems the design solves. This documentation serves evidentiary function in establishing the originality and specificity of the protected structure.

**Development History**: Commit logs, version histories, and iterative refinements that demonstrate the evolution of the logical structure, distinguishing it from generic or obvious approaches.

**Dependency Maps**: Visual and textual representations of component relationships, data flows, and system topology that make the architectural design explicit and defensible.

### 5.4 Limitations and Acknowledgments

The Author acknowledges that protection of logical structure and architectural design:
- May exceed the scope of traditional copyright law in some jurisdictions
- Relies partly on contractual terms (license conditions) rather than purely on property rights
- Derives enforceability from the combination of legal uncertainty (creating risk for potential violators), community norms (creating social cost for violation), and explicit contractual commitment (creating breach of contract liability)

This protection is offered as a **deterrent and declaration of intent**, not as a guarantee of legal remedy. Its primary function is to signal that enclosure through reimplementation is contrary to the Author's explicit wishes and the community's shared norms.

## 6. CONTRIBUTOR PROTECTION AND BRIDGING CLAUSE

### 6.1 The Asymmetry Problem

In many open-source projects, there exists an asymmetry between the original author and subsequent contributors:
- The author controls the repository, license, and project direction
- Contributors invest significant labor without guarantee that their contributions will remain free
- If the author abandons the project, sells out, or dies, contributors may find their work captured or lost
- If the author permits enclosure, contributors have no recourse to protect their own labor

### 6.2 Mutual Assurance Mechanism

RCNM creates structural assurance for Significant Contributors through:

**Author's Binding Commitment**: The Author cannot sell out, revoke the license, or permit proprietary derivatives. This protects contributors from the author's future compromise.

**Contributor's Reciprocal Commitment**: Contributors must release modifications under the same license terms, preventing any party from privatizing the collective work.

**Perpetual Commons Guarantee**: The combination of irrevocability and share-alike requirements ensures that the work remains in the commons regardless of individual participants' future actions or mortality.

### 6.3 The Bridge: Scaffold and Significance

RCNM explicitly addresses the scenario where:
- A modest author creates a basic scaffold or initial implementation
- A Significant Contributor adds substantial value, major features, or architectural improvements
- The original author subsequently disappears, burns out, or dies

**Protection for Significant Contributors**:
- The license remains in force, preventing heirs or successors from enclosing the combined work
- The Significant Contributor may fork the project and continue maintenance under the same license
- The Significant Contributor's improvements remain protected from corporate capture through the non-monetization clause
- The original scaffold remains available, ensuring the contributor's work is not orphaned

### 6.4 Recognition of Labor

While RCNM prohibits monetization, it mandates attribution that explicitly recognizes:
- The original Author's scaffold
- Each Significant Contributor's specific contributions
- The AI systems involved in the collaborative production

This recognition serves non-economic functions: reputation, lineage, and historical record.

## 7. REPOSITORY MANAGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTED PERSISTENCE

### 7.1 Repository as Temporal Instance

**Definition**: The "Repository" refers to any specific hosting instance where the Software is maintained at a given time. The Repository is distinct from the Software itself and from the License. The Repository is a **container**; the Software and License are **contents**.

**Principle of Container Independence**: The existence, ownership, or accessibility of any specific Repository instance does not affect the validity or enforceability of the License. The License binds the Software, not the hosting platform.

### 7.2 Repository Mortality and Succession

**Acknowledged Risk**: The original Repository where the Software was first published may cease to exist due to:
- Platform closure or policy change
- Account termination or suspension
- Author death or incapacity without succession
- Technical failure or data loss
- Author decision to delete or privatize

**Succession Mechanism**: Upon failure or deactivation of the original Repository:

1. **Automatic Lineage Rights**: Any public library, archive, or hosting platform may assume custody of the Software
2. **License Inheritance**: The assuming entity must inherit all documentation, including:
   - Full license text and all appendices
   - Temporal anchoring records (Section 4.6)
   - Contribution logs and attribution records
   - Design rationale and architectural documentation
   - Child repository registry (Section 7.4)
   - Incorporation registry (Section 8)
3. **No Modification Authority**: The assuming entity gains no authority to modify license terms, only to maintain accessibility
4. **Distributed Custody Encouraged**: Multiple entities may simultaneously host the Software; no exclusive custody is recognized

### 7.3 Public Library Obligations

Entities assuming custody of RCNM-licensed Software (including but not limited to academic repositories, national libraries, Internet Archive, GitHub mirrors, or community forks) must:

**Documentation Preservation**:
- Maintain complete copy of LICENSE.md and all referenced documentation
- Preserve commit history and version records where technically feasible
- Retain timestamp and temporal anchoring records
- Maintain accessibility of design rationale and architectural documentation

**License Integrity**:
- Apply identical license terms to hosted copy
- Not impose additional access restrictions (paywalls, registration requirements)
- Not modify or truncate license text
- Clearly indicate provenance and original author

**No Authority to Alter**: Public libraries act as **stewards**, not **owners**. They may not:
- Re-license the Software
- Authorize proprietary derivatives
- Remove or weaken attribution requirements
- Claim ownership of architectural or logical elements

### 7.4 Child Repository Registry and Lineage Documentation

**Definition of Child Repository**: Any derivative project, fork, substantial modification, or reimplementation that:
- Incorporates code, logic, or architecture from the Parent Repository
- Is distributed or made publicly available
- Constitutes a distinct project with its own maintenance

**Mandatory Registration**: Entities creating Child Repositories must:

1. **Log Child to Parent**: Record the Child Repository in the Parent Repository's registry (if accessible) through:
   - Pull request adding entry to CHILDREN.md or equivalent registry file
   - Issue submission with Child Repository metadata
   - Direct communication to Parent Repository maintainer

2. **Lineage Documentation in Child**: Child Repository must include:
   - Explicit statement of Parent origin
   - URL to original Parent Repository
   - Description of modifications or scope of derivation
   - RCNM license application (same terms)
   - Link back to Parent's license documentation

**Registry Format** (example CHILDREN.md):
```markdown
# Child Repositories
