# RCNM PRINCIPLES AND MANIFESTO

## Research Commons Non-Monetization License

---

## FROM DECLARATION TO PRINCIPLE

The [Declaration of Hope and Intent](DECLARATION.md) states **why** this license was built. This document explains **how** its architecture serves those motivations—the principles that shape its design and the norms it seeks to establish.

---

## PRINCIPLE 1: ABUNDANCE OVER SCARCITY

### The Old Logic

Traditional intellectual property assumes **scarcity**: creative works require irreplaceable human time, training, and sacrifice. Because creation is costly, creators deserve exclusive rights to recoup investment.

### The New Reality

AI-assisted production breaks this logic. A developer with domain expertise can generate, through collaboration with AI systems, in hours what once required years of training and execution. The **marginal cost of creation approaches zero**.

### The Implication

When creation is abundant, **exclusive rights become rents, not incentives**. The question is no longer "how do we incentivize creation?" but "how do we prevent enclosure of abundant resources?"

RCNM answers: **remove the incentive to enclose**. If you cannot sell the tool itself, you extract no rent from abundance. The commons remains open.

---

## PRINCIPLE 2: USE OVER SALE

### The Distinction

RCNM distinguishes sharply between:

| Permitted: Commercial Use | Prohibited: Commercial Sale |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Using the tool in business operations | Selling the tool as a product |
| Offering services that happen to use the tool | Charging fees to access the tool |
| Including the tool in research for profit | Paywalling the tool or derivatives |
| Building upon the tool for client work | Creating "Enterprise Edition" |

### The Test

&gt; Is someone paying primarily to access THIS SOFTWARE, or are they paying for a broader service that happens to use this Software as one component?

- If for the Software itself: **prohibited**
- If for broader service (and Software remains free): **permitted**

This preserves **economic autonomy**—users can sustain themselves through their labor—while prohibiting **rent extraction** from the tool itself.

---

## PRINCIPLE 3: PERSISTENCE OVER POPULARITY

### The Trade-off

Most licenses optimize for adoption. They minimize friction for corporate legal departments, package managers, and institutional procurement. They seek the widest possible distribution.

RCNM accepts **narrower adoption** in exchange for **deeper persistence**:

| Traditional License | RCNM |
|---------------------|------|
| Corporate-friendly | Corporate-averse |
| Wide distribution | Deep persistence |
| Short-term adoption | Long-term survival |
| Compatibility with enclosure | Resistance to enclosure |

### The Goal

A tool that remains free in 2056, used by researchers who never knew the original author, maintained by communities that outlived the platform where it was born. **Legacy over popularity.**

---

## PRINCIPLE 4: TEMPORAL BINDING

### The Problem

Most licenses bind the present. The author can change their mind. The author can sell out. The author can die, leaving heirs who do not share their commitments.

### The Solution

RCNM binds **the future**:

- **Irrevocability**: The author cannot revoke the license
- **Posthumous binding**: The license becomes immutable upon death
- **Non-hereditary principles**: Heirs inherit copyright, not license-modification authority
- **15-day delay**: Prevents rushed or coerced changes

The author **pre-commits** their future self, protecting the work from their own future weakness or compromise.

---

## PRINCIPLE 5: DISTRIBUTED SOVEREIGNTY

### The Architecture

RCNM rejects centralization:

| Centralized Risk | RCNM Alternative |
|------------------|------------------|
| Single author can sell out | Irrevocability prevents |
| Single platform can remove | Distributed custody enables |
| Single heir can enclose | Non-hereditary principles prevent |
| Single point of failure | Multiplicity ensures persistence |

### The Mechanism

- **Child Repository independence**: Children automatically become sovereign upon parent re-licensing
- **Structural fixation**: Base structure in Children is permanently RCNM-licensed
- **New Root declaration**: Any Child can become a new lineage root
- **Public library succession**: Any entity can assume custody if original fails

**No single entity controls the ecosystem.** The commons is **antifragile**—it gains from attempts to disrupt it.

---

## PRINCIPLE 6: RECIPROCAL AI FAIRNESS

### The Exchange

When you use an AI system, you **give** and **receive**:

| You Give | You Receive |
|----------|-------------|
| Prompts, creativity, direction | Generated outputs |
| Corrections, feedback | Assistance, capabilities |
| Usage patterns, evaluations | Improved model performance |

Your contributions **train the model**. The model's outputs **assist you**. This is **reciprocal**, not transactional.

### The Claim

AI model holders cannot claim **exclusive ownership of outputs** when:
- You accessed the model under general public terms
- Your interactions improved the model
- You provided value without explicit compensation

The **Fair Use Shield** asserts: outputs generated through public access are **permanently free** from retroactive proprietary claims.

---

## PRINCIPLE 7: NORMATIVE ENFORCEMENT

### The Layers

RCNM does not rely primarily on courts. It builds **multiple enforcement modes**:

| Layer | Mechanism | Independence from Courts |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Technical | Forking, cryptography, distribution | Complete |
| Social | Reputation, community sanction | Near-complete |
| Contractual | License as agreement | Partial |
| Copyright | Traditional IP enforcement | None |

### The Strategy

- **Deterrence through uncertainty**: Legal ambiguity makes risk-averse actors hesitate
- **Persistence through multiplicity**: Many copies exist; none can be recalled
- **Compliance through alignment**: Those who share principles enforce norms voluntarily
- **Last-resort litigation**: Reserved for egregious violations

**Sociological strength, not doctrinal strength.**

---

## PRINCIPLE 8: LINEAGE TRANSPARENCY

### The Requirement

All derivatives must **document their origin**:

- Child Repositories register with parent
- Incorporations disclose their source
- Modifications indicate what was changed
- Attribution chains remain traceable across generations

### The Purpose

- **Accountability**: Violations are visible
- **Gratitude**: Contributors receive recognition
- **History**: The commons remembers its builders
- **Integrity**: Users know the provenance of their tools

**Transparency is the immune system of the commons.**

---

## PRINCIPLE 9: HONEST SCOPE

### The Limitation

RCNM does **not** claim to:

- Prevent all enclosure (determined actors will find ways)
- Guarantee legal certainty (it is experimental)
- Replace traditional IP for all use cases
- Protect against well-resourced adversaries willing to litigate

### The Honesty

It **does** claim to:

- Make enclosure **more costly** than traditional licenses
- Demonstrate that **alternative architectures are possible**
- Coordinate **value-aligned communities**
- **Persist through multiplicity** even when individual nodes fail

**It is a filter, not a fortress.** It selects for those who share its values, not those seeking maximum legal protection.

---

## PRINCIPLE 10: SCAFFOLD NOT MONUMENT

### The Metaphor

RCNM is not a **monument**—permanent, unchanging, authoritative. It is a **scaffold**—temporary, improvable, meant to be built upon and eventually replaced.

### The Invitation

- Use it if it serves you
- Improve it if you can
- Replace it if you find better
- Pass forward what you learn

The goal is not **orthodoxy** but **progress**. The commons evolves. So must its instruments.

---

## CONCLUSION: THE COMMONS WE SEEK

We seek a commons where:

- Independent developers can build without fear of extraction
- Tools persist beyond their creators' mortality
- AI-assisted abundance is shared, not monopolized
- Communities enforce norms through reputation and coordination
- Legal instruments serve persistence, not enclosure

This is not utopia. It is **practical hope**. Stubborn, incremental, multi-generational.

Read the [Declaration](DECLARATION.md) for the human motivation.
Read the [Legal Text](LICENSE-FULL.md) for the operative terms.
Read the [Justification](LICENSE-JUSTIFICATION.md) for the doctrinal arguments.

Then decide if you will join us.
