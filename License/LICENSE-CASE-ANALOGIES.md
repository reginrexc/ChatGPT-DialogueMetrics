# CASE ANALOGIES AND DOCTRINAL SUPPORT

## PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This document identifies **established legal cases** that **support, illuminate, or provide analogies** for RCNM provisions. It does **not** claim these cases are direct precedent for RCNM—most provisions are novel and untested. Rather, it demonstrates that RCNM's architecture is **grounded in recognized legal doctrines**, not invented without legal basis.

**Key distinction:**
- **Supporting precedent**: Case establishes doctrine RCNM relies upon
- **Illuminating analogy**: Case suggests how court might approach similar issue
- **Novel provision**: RCNM goes beyond existing case law (noted explicitly)

### Cross-Jurisdictional Harmonization Through Intent

The cases cited herein span multiple legal systems—common law, civil law, and hybrid traditions. They do not always agree. A holding in the United States may contradict one in France; a German doctrine may have no analogue in Australia.

Yet this very multiplicity serves a function. It demonstrates that the principles underlying RCNM—irrevocability, moral rights, contractual autonomy, fair use reciprocity—are not parochial inventions. They are **humanity's varied attempts** to solve similar problems: How do we protect creation? How do we bind the future? How do we prevent enclosure?

Where jurisdictions **converge**, we find strong support. Where they **diverge**, we find evidence that RCNM's specific configuration is **one possible answer among many**, not an imposition of single tradition.

The cross-country jurisprudence thus functions as **what humanity across the world thinks about these issues**. It may not be complimentary, but it shows **intent and understanding in various sections of the world**. RCNM draws from this global conversation, offering its own synthesis.

| **Holding** | Congress may restore copyright to public domain works for limited times to comply with international treaties; public domain is not "territory that works may never exit" but Congress can modify scope |
| **RCNM Analogy** | Congressional authority to protect public domain works suggests parallel authority to protect commons through licensing; RCNM creates "protected commons" analogous to restored public domain; policy flexibility in IP system |
| **Support Level** | Illuminating analogy for policy flexibility; supports argument that RCNM's commons-preservation is within IP system scope |

| **Holding** | Government must provide access to essential medicines; socioeconomic rights are enforceable; resource constraints do not excuse complete inaction; progressive realization required |
| **RCNM Analogy** | Essential access rights override property constraints; humanitarian necessity creates enforceable obligations; RCNM's public interest override similarly prioritizes essential access over exclusivity |

| **Jurisdiction** | France, Court of Cassation (Supreme Court) |
| **Holding** | Successors of author cannot oppose publication of work that author intended to publish; author's intent for dissemination binds heirs; moral rights do not include power to suppress author's intended distribution |
| **RCNM Analogy** | Author's intent for commons dedication binds heirs; successors cannot suppress RCNM-licensed work; moral rights protect integrity, not enclosure contrary to author intent |
| **Support Level** | Strong supporting precedent for author intent binding successors; directly supports posthumous binding |

The following RCNM provisions are **genuinely novel** and lack direct case support. They are offered as **experiments** in legal architecture:

| RCNM Provision | Novelty | Basis in Doctrine |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| 15-day deactivation delay | Procedural innovation | Contract formation, cooling-off periods |
| Mandatory public release of modifications | Stricter than GPL | Contractual condition precedent |
| AI Fair Use Shield | Unprecedented application | Fair use parity, promissory estoppel |
| Structural fixation temporal locking | Novel covenant design | License covenants, temporal jurisdiction |
| Instantaneous orphan mechanism | Novel property theory | Contract non-assignment, third-party rights |

**Honest assessment**: These provisions may fail in court. They are designed to **deter through uncertainty**, **signal intent**, and **establish norms** even if judicial enforcement is uncertain.

## GLOBAL CONVERSATION, LOCAL SYNTHESIS

RCNM's case analogies span five continents and multiple legal traditions. This is intentional. We do not claim that French moral rights doctrine binds American courts, or that Australian native title law governs German copyright disputes.

Rather, we claim that **humanity has been thinking about these problems everywhere**, and RCNM learns from all of it. The license is a **synthesis of global intent**, adapted to the specific problem of AI-assisted independent creation.

Where your jurisdiction recognizes a doctrine we cite, you have **strong support**. Where it does not, you have **illumination**—a way of seeing what is possible, what others have tried, what might be argued.

This is not legal imperialism. It is **legal cosmopolitanism**: respectful engagement with how the world thinks about protecting creation from capture.

## CONCLUSION: GROUNDED BUT AMBITIOUS

RCNM rests on **established doctrinal foundations**:

- Contract law (irrevocability, consideration, third-party effects)
- Copyright law (license conditions, fair use)
- Moral rights (integrity, survival)
- Public interest jurisprudence (exceptional overrides)

It **stretches** these foundations in novel directions. It does not claim certainty. It claims **coherence** and **good-faith effort** to protect the commons within existing legal frameworks.

Courts may reject our stretches. But they will see that RCNM is **not amateur invention**. It is **informed experimentation**, grounded in serious legal doctrine, offered for those who share its hopes.

Read the [Declaration](DECLARATION.md) for the human motivation.
Read the [Principles](LICENSE-PRINCIPLES.md) for the architectural logic.
Read the [Legal Text](LICENSE-FULL.md) for the operative terms.

Then decide if this grounded experiment is worth joining.
