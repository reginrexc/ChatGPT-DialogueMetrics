# CASE ANALOGIES AND DOCTRINAL SUPPORT

## PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This document identifies **established legal cases** that **support, illuminate, or provide analogies** for RCNM provisions. It does **not** claim these cases are direct precedent for RCNM—most provisions are novel and untested. Rather, it demonstrates that RCNM's architecture is **grounded in recognized legal doctrines**, not invented without legal basis.

**Key distinction:**
- **Supporting precedent**: Case establishes doctrine RCNM relies upon
- **Illuminating analogy**: Case suggests how court might approach similar issue
- **Novel provision**: RCNM goes beyond existing case law (noted explicitly)

### Cross-Jurisdictional Harmonization Through Intent

The cases cited herein span multiple legal systems—common law, civil law, and hybrid traditions. They do not always agree. A holding in the United States may contradict one in France; a German doctrine may have no analogue in Australia.

Yet this very multiplicity serves a function. It demonstrates that the principles underlying RCNM—irrevocability, moral rights, contractual autonomy, fair use reciprocity—are not parochial inventions. They are **humanity's varied attempts** to solve similar problems: How do we protect creation? How do we bind the future? How do we prevent enclosure?

Where jurisdictions **converge**, we find strong support. Where they **diverge**, we find evidence that RCNM's specific configuration is **one possible answer among many**, not an imposition of single tradition.

The cross-country jurisprudence thus functions as **what humanity across the world thinks about these issues**. It may not be complimentary, but it shows **intent and understanding in various sections of the world**. RCNM draws from this global conversation, offering its own synthesis.

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|

| **Holding** | Derivative work creator's rights are independent of underlying work; termination of underlying license doesn't automatically terminate derivative rights; derivative creator has independently cognizable interests |
| **RCNM Analogy** | Child Repository creators have independent rights in their modifications; parent's re-licensing doesn't automatically terminate child's independent interests; orphan mechanism recognizes this independence |

| Attribute | Detail |

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Jurisdiction** | South Africa, Constitutional Court |
| **Holding** | Socio-economic rights may override property rights in exceptional circumstances |
| **RCNM Analogy** | Humanitarian necessity may temporarily override commons preservation |
| **Support Level** | Illuminating analogy for rights balancing |

---

## PART VII: NOVEL PROVISIONS (NO DIRECT PRECEDENT)

The following RCNM provisions are **genuinely novel** and lack direct case support. They are offered as **experiments** in legal architecture:

| RCNM Provision | Novelty | Basis in Doctrine |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| 15-day deactivation delay | Procedural innovation | Contract formation, cooling-off periods |
| Mandatory public release of modifications | Stricter than GPL | Contractual condition precedent |
| AI Fair Use Shield | Unprecedented application | Fair use parity, promissory estoppel |
| Structural fixation temporal locking | Novel covenant design | License covenants, temporal jurisdiction |
| Instantaneous orphan mechanism | Novel property theory | Contract non-assignment, third-party rights |

**Honest assessment**: These provisions may fail in court. They are designed to **deter through uncertainty**, **signal intent**, and **establish norms** even if judicial enforcement is uncertain.

---

## GLOBAL CONVERSATION, LOCAL SYNTHESIS

RCNM's case analogies span five continents and multiple legal traditions. This is intentional. We do not claim that French moral rights doctrine binds American courts, or that Australian native title law governs German copyright disputes.

Rather, we claim that **humanity has been thinking about these problems everywhere**, and RCNM learns from all of it. The license is a **synthesis of global intent**, adapted to the specific problem of AI-assisted independent creation.

Where your jurisdiction recognizes a doctrine we cite, you have **strong support**. Where it does not, you have **illumination**—a way of seeing what is possible, what others have tried, what might be argued.

This is not legal imperialism. It is **legal cosmopolitanism**: respectful engagement with how the world thinks about protecting creation from capture.

---

## CONCLUSION: GROUNDED BUT AMBITIOUS

RCNM rests on **established doctrinal foundations**:

- Contract law (irrevocability, consideration, third-party effects)
- Copyright law (license conditions, fair use)
- Moral rights (integrity, survival)
- Public interest jurisprudence (exceptional overrides)

It **stretches** these foundations in novel directions. It does not claim certainty. It claims **coherence** and **good-faith effort** to protect the commons within existing legal frameworks.

Courts may reject our stretches. But they will see that RCNM is **not amateur invention**. It is **informed experimentation**, grounded in serious legal doctrine, offered for those who share its hopes.

Read the [Declaration](DECLARATION.md) for the human motivation.
Read the [Principles](LICENSE-PRINCIPLES.md) for the architectural logic.
Read the [Legal Text](LICENSE-FULL.md) for the operative terms.

Then decide if this grounded experiment is worth joining.
