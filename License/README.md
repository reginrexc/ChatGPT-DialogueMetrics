## KEY DISTINCTIONS

### Binding vs. Non-Binding

| Binding (Legal Force) | Non-Binding (Context Only) |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| ../LICENSE.md (root) | DECLARATION.md |
| LICENSE-FULL.md | LICENSE-PRINCIPLES.md |
| | LICENSE-JUSTIFICATION.md |
| | LICENSE-CASE-ANALOGIES.md |
| | LICENSE-SUMMARY.md |
| | LICENSE-HISTORY.md |

### Hierarchy of Documents

In case of conflict:
1. **LICENSE-FULL.md** controls (most specific legal text)
2. **../LICENSE.md** (root) incorporates by reference
3. Non-binding documents provide interpretive context

## DOCUMENTATION PRINCIPLES

RCNM's documentation follows these design choices:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Separation of concerns** | Human motivation (Declaration), philosophy (Principles), law (Full Text), advocacy (Justification) are separate |
| **Honest about limitations** | Declaration explicitly states what RCNM cannot do |
| **Modular architecture** | Each document stands alone; cross-references link them |
| **Multiple entry points** | Different users start at different documents based on needs |
| **No duplication** | Content appears in one primary location only |

---

## VERSION INFORMATION

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **License Version** | 1.0 |
| **Release Date** | February 2026 |

## FINAL NOTE

&gt; The commons does not require perfection. It requires many hands. It requires persistence. It requires hope that is stubborn.

Read the [Declaration](DECLARATION.md). Then decide if this is your fight.
