# LICENSE SUMMARY

## Research Commons Non-Monetization License (RCNM) v1.0

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This is a **plain-language summary**, not the actual license. It has **no legal force**. The binding terms are in [LICENSE-FULL.md](LICENSE-FULL.md) and [../LICENSE.md](../LICENSE.md).

Read the [Declaration of Hope and Intent](DECLARATION.md) before using this license. RCNM is **experimental** and **legally ambitious**. It prioritizes commons persistence over judicial certainty.

---

## THE BIG IDEA

RCNM protects **AI-assisted tools created by independent developers** from being captured by corporations or institutions. It ensures these tools:

- Stay **free forever** (no paywalls, no sales)
- **Outlive their creators** (can't be sold out after death)
- **Remain independent** (children can't be captured by parent sale)
- **Resist patent claims** on AI outputs (fair use shield)

---

## WHAT YOU CAN DO (PERMITTED)

| Activity | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Use** the software | Run it, analyze data, build projects |
| **Modify** the software | Add features, fix bugs, adapt to your needs |
| **Distribute** the software | Share with others, publish online |
| **Use commercially** | Use in your business, research, consulting |
| **Create derivatives** | Fork it, build on it, make it yours |
| **Offer services** | Use it as part of your service (if software stays free) |

**Key rule**: The software itself must remain free. You can make money *with* it, not *from* it.

---

## WHAT YOU CANNOT DO (PROHIBITED)

| Activity | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Sell the software** | Core principle: no monetization of the tool itself |
| **Charge for access** | No paywalls, no subscription fees for the software |
| **Create "Pro" versions** | No tiered pricing, no enterprise editions |
| **Bundle as primary selling point** | Can't be the main attraction of a paid product |
| **Claim patents on AI outputs** | Fair use shield protects users |

**Simple test**: Are people paying primarily to get *this software*, or for something bigger that happens to use it?

- Paying for software → **NOT ALLOWED**
- Paying for service/analysis that uses software → **ALLOWED**

---

## WHAT YOU MUST DO (REQUIREMENTS)

| Requirement | How |
|-------------|-----|
| **Give credit** | Include author name, AI systems used, link to original |
| **Share alike** | Release your modifications under same RCNM terms |
| **Document changes** | Say what you modified |
| **Register children** | If you fork, log it in the original's CHILDREN.md |
| **Disclose use** | If you use parts in other projects, document it |

---

## KEY PROTECTIONS

### For Users

| Protection | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Irrevocable** | Author can't change mind and sell out |
| **Posthumous binding** | License survives author's death, heirs can't enclose |
| **15-day delay** | Even if author tries to change, 15 days to reconsider |
| **Child independence** | If parent sells out, children automatically stay free |
| **Structural fixation** | Base code you forked stays free forever |
| **AI fair use shield** | AI model holders can't patent your outputs |

### For Contributors

| Protection | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Your work stays free** | Your contributions can't be captured |
| **Parent can't sell your work** | Author only licenses what they own (not your contributions) |
| **Orphan status** | If parent disappears, you keep going independently |

---

## WHO IS THIS FOR?

| Good fit | Not a fit |
|----------|-----------|
| Independent developers | Corporations needing standard licenses |
| Researchers building tools | Those wanting to monetize the tool itself |
| Commons-minded creators | Those needing legal certainty above all |
| AI-assisted tool builders | Traditional software with clear authorship |
| Long-term thinkers | Short-term commercial projects |

---

## COMPARISON: RCNM VS. OTHER LICENSES

| License | Can sell software? | Must share modifications? | Survives author death? | Protects AI outputs? |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| MIT | Yes | No | No | No |
| GPL | Yes (with source) | Yes | No | No |
| CC BY-NC | No | No | No | No |
| Apache | Yes | No | No | No |
| **RCNM** | **No** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |

---

## RISKS AND LIMITATIONS

| Risk | Reality |
|------|---------|
| **Not court-tested** | Provisions are novel; may fail in litigation |
| **Corporations may avoid** | Non-standard; legal departments may reject |
| **Ambiguity** | Some terms intentionally broad for deterrence |
| **Not OSI/FSF approved** | Institutional procurement may hesitate |
| **Determined actors may bypass** | Well-resourced adversaries can reimplement |

**Honest assessment**: RCNM is a **filter**, not a **fortress**. It selects for aligned communities, not maximum protection.
