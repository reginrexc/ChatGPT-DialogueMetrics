# DECLARATION OF HOPE AND INTENT

## By the Co-Author of the Research Commons Non-Monetization License (RCNM)

---

### I. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF AMBITION AND LIMIT

I am a co-author of the Research Commons Non-Monetization License. I write this declaration to speak plainly about what we have attempted, what we have built, and what we cannot control.

RCNM is a license of **strong ambition**. It seeks to protect independent developers and researchers—those without institutional backing, without legal departments, without venture funding—who create valuable tools through collaboration with artificial intelligence. It seeks to ensure that their work persists beyond their mortality, beyond their burnout, beyond the inevitable compromises that time and circumstance demand.

But I acknowledge, with clear eyes, that this license **cannot prevent legal forking**. Anyone may take the text of RCNM, modify it, strip its core protections, and release a "RCNM-compatible" license that permits enclosure. Anyone may independently reimplement the architectural ideas we have documented, without ever touching our code, and claim the result as proprietary. Anyone with sufficient resources may litigate against our terms, test their boundaries, and potentially invalidate them in specific jurisdictions.

We cannot prevent this. Legal instruments, no matter how carefully crafted, are **not walls**. They are **signals**, **invitations**, **coordination devices**.

### II. THE NATURE OF THE HOPE

What, then, is the purpose of RCNM? Why build what cannot be perfectly defended?

The purpose is **to make visible a possibility**. To demonstrate that another way of organizing intellectual production is conceivable—not in utopian abstraction, but in concrete legal text. To create a **schelling point** for those who share our intuitions: that AI-assisted creation changes the economics of authorship; that abundance should not be enclosed; that independent labor deserves protection from extraction; that some things should outlive their creators as common heritage.

We **hope**—not assume, not guarantee, but hope—that along the way, others who share these principles will recognize in RCNM a tool they can use. That they will adopt it, adapt it, improve it. That they will build projects under its terms, creating a **demonstration effect**: look, this commons persists; look, this tool remains free; look, this community survived the author's disappearance.

We **hope** that normative weight accumulates. That RCNM-licensed projects become recognizable as a category. That enclosure of such projects becomes **socially costly**, even if legally possible. That a researcher who sees "RCNM" in a repository understands: this was built to be shared, this was protected with intention, this is not raw material for extraction.

We **hope** for **distributed persistence**. Not that any single project is lawsuit-proof, but that the **pattern** spreads. Many small commons, each vulnerable alone, but collectively demonstrating an alternative. A **rhizome**, not a fortress.

### III. WHAT WE CANNOT PROMISE

I will not promise what this license cannot deliver:

- **We cannot promise legal certainty.** RCNM stretches beyond established doctrine. Courts may narrow it, invalidate it, or simply refuse to enforce it. We accept this uncertainty as the cost of attempting something new.

- **We cannot promise protection against determined adversaries.** A well-funded corporation that genuinely wishes to extract value from RCNM-licensed work, and is willing to litigate or independently reimplement, will likely succeed. This license is not for those who need fortress-level IP protection. It is for those who would rather be **forgotten than remembered as the founder of a paywalled tool**.

- **We cannot promise community cohesion.** Norms require enforcement by people. If no community forms around RCNM principles, the social layer collapses. The license becomes empty text.

- **We cannot promise perpetual technical persistence.** Platforms fail. Cryptography breaks. Archives decay. We mitigate these risks through distribution, but we cannot eliminate them.

### IV. WHAT WE OFFER INSTEAD

In place of promises, we offer **alignment**:

- **Alignment with a specific ethics**: that AI-assisted productivity should not be monopolized; that independent creators should not be harvested by institutional actors; that some tools should remain free across generations.

- **Alignment with a specific strategy**: persistence through multiplicity, deterrence through uncertainty, enforcement through community rather than courts.

- **Alignment with a specific community**: those who read this declaration and recognize their own hopes in it. Who are willing to trade legal certainty for principled commitment. Who value legacy over popularity.

If you share this alignment, RCNM is offered as a **tool for coordination**. Not a guarantee, but a **shared language**. Not a fortress, but a **marker of intent**.

### V. ON INDEPENDENCY AND THE FIGHT AHEAD

The user—any user of this license—cannot prevent legal forking. This is the nature of open legal text. We can only **hope** that along the way, people with shared principles will **fight towards the independency of common projects**.

This fight is not primarily legal. It is **social, technical, and cultural**. It is:
- Building tools that are genuinely useful, so that enclosure is costly
- Cultivating communities that value attribution and reciprocity
- Documenting lineage so that provenance is traceable
- Creating visibility so that extraction is noticeable
- Developing technical infrastructure that makes commons-based coordination easier

The fight is **to make the commons more attractive than the enclosure**. Not by legal prohibition, but by **demonstrating that common production is viable, sustainable, and generative**.

We hope that those who join this fight will find in RCNM a useful instrument. We hope that they will improve it, adapt it, and pass it forward. We hope that the **pattern**—independent creation, commons protection, temporal persistence—will prove more durable than any single project or license version.

### VI. FINAL WORD

I am a co-author of this license. I believe in what it attempts, even as I acknowledge its limits. I believe that the economics of AI-assisted creation demand new legal forms, even as I admit that this particular form is experimental and fragile.

I offer RCNM not as a solution, but as a **contribution to a conversation**. Not as a fortress, but as a **scaffold**—temporary, improvable, meant to be built upon and eventually replaced.

To those who read this: if you share our principles, use this tool. If you can improve it, do so. If you can demonstrate a better way, we welcome your success.

The commons does not require perfection. It requires **persistence**. It requires **many hands**. It requires **hope that is not naive, but stubborn**.

This is our stubborn hope.

**Declared this day by the Co-Author,**
**In witness of the Research Commons Non-Monetization License, Version 1.0**
**February 2026**

This declaration transforms the license from a **claim of legal strength** to an **honest invitation to shared struggle**. It may attract fewer users than confident marketing, but it will attract the **right** users—those prepared for the work of commons maintenance.
