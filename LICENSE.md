**Mandatory Public Release of Modifications:**

All entities (institutions, commercial entities, research labs, or any other form of organization) that modify this Software are **MANDATED** to:

1. **Release modifications publicly** under this same license (RCNM)
2. **Choose one of the following**:
   - **Option A:** Contribute modifications back to the original repository via pull request, OR
   - **Option B:** Create a separate public repository with:
     - Proper attribution to the parent project
     - Clear indication of what was modified
     - Link to the original repository
     - This same RCNM license applied

3. **Inheritance requirement:** Each derivative project (child project) will **inherit the same licensing agreement** as the parent project, unless the original author provides **explicit written authorization** for different terms.

4. **No private modifications:** Modified versions MUST be made publicly available. Private, internal-only modifications that are used in production are NOT permitted unless:
   - The modifications are contributed back to the public repository, OR
   - The entity contacts the author for a separate commercial licensing agreement

**Clarification of "Non-Monetization":**

This clause prohibits **direct monetization of the Software itself**, but does NOT prohibit:

- ✓ Using the Software in commercial research operations
- ✓ Using the Software to analyze data for commercial purposes  
- ✓ Offering services that utilize the Software (if the Software remains freely available)
- ✓ Including the Software in commercial research environments
- ✓ Using the Software in for-profit institutions
- ✓ Publishing research papers using the Software (including in paid journals)
- ✓ Receiving grants or funding for research that uses the Software

**Examples of PERMITTED uses:**
- A pharmaceutical company uses the Software to analyze internal AI dialogue data (the Software remains free and public)
- A consultancy offers research services and uses this Software as one of many analytical tools (the Software remains free and public)
- A university uses the Software in a paid research contract (the Software remains free and public)
- A startup uses the Software to analyze customer support conversations (the Software remains free and public)
- A research lab receives NIH funding for a study that employs this Software (the Software remains free and public)
- A company modifies the Software for internal use and releases their modifications publicly under RCNM

**Examples of PROHIBITED uses:**
- Selling the Software on a marketplace for $99
- Creating "DialogueMetrics Pro" with a license fee
- Requiring payment to access your modified version
- Bundling the Software into a paid software suite where the Software is a primary selling point
- Creating a SaaS platform where this Software is the main product being sold
- Integrating the Software's code or architecture into a commercial product without releasing the integration publicly
- Incorporating the analytical framework into proprietary software
- Using the logical structure of the code as the foundation for a commercial tool without public release
- Repackaging the Software with minor modifications as a paid product
- Creating a "white-label" version for sale to clients

**Test for Compliance:**
"Is someone paying primarily to access THIS SOFTWARE (or its code, architecture, or logical structure), or are they paying for a broader service/product that happens to use this Software as one component?"

- If primarily for the Software itself or its architecture → PROHIBITED
- If for broader service/research/product (and Software remains free) → PERMITTED

**Architectural Protection Test:**
"If I remove this Software's code/architecture/logic, does the commercial product still function substantially?"

- If NO (the product depends on this Software's architecture) → Must release integration publicly under RCNM
- If YES (the product is independent) → Commercial product acceptable, as long as this Software remains free and unmodified

### 4. Share-Alike Requirement (MANDATORY)

If you distribute modified versions of the Software, you MUST:
- ⚠ License them under these same terms (RCNM License)
- ⚠ Ensure derivatives remain free and non-monetized
- ⚠ Preserve the non-monetization clause
- ⚠ Maintain the same freedoms for all users

This prevents:
- Creating proprietary forks
- Closing off derivative works
- Restricting access to improvements
- Gatekeeping by institutions

### 5. Standardization and Institutional Use

This license explicitly permits and encourages:
- ✓ Adoption as standard tool across institutions
- ✓ Integration into research pipelines
- ✓ Inclusion in computational infrastructure
- ✓ Collaborative improvement by research community
- ✓ Cross-institutional standardization efforts

This license explicitly prohibits:
- ✗ Institutional gatekeeping through paywalls
- ✗ Proprietary versions by research labs
- ✗ Access restrictions by universities or corporations
- ✗ Commercialization by tool vendors

## Rationale for This License

### Why Non-Monetization?

This Software was created through AI collaboration, not traditional coding labor. The author believes that:

1. **AI-assisted tools should remain freely accessible** to prevent a future where AI-generated productivity is monopolized through paywalls.

2. **If monetization were permitted**, the ease of AI-collaboration would enable mass-production of paywalled tools, degrading the open research commons.

3. **Institutional gatekeeping must be prevented** to ensure independent researchers globally can access research-grade tools.

4. **Commercial use is encouraged** (using the tool in business), but commercial sale is prohibited (selling the tool itself).

5. **Standardization requires freedom** - tools cannot become standard if locked behind institutional or commercial barriers.

### Why Commercial Use Is Explicitly Permitted

The author deliberately permits commercial operational use because:

1. **Commercial entities can validate at scale** - Companies have resources, datasets, and infrastructure to test the tool thoroughly, discovering bugs and edge cases that academic research alone would miss.

2. **Commercial use drives standardization** - When companies adopt tools in their operations, they push for reliability, documentation, and standardization that benefits everyone.

3. **Improvements must remain public** - By requiring companies to share modifications freely, commercial testing improves the public version. Everyone benefits from commercial resources, not just the company.

4. **Prevents "swoop and commercialize" pattern** - The non-monetization clause blocks the common pattern where companies take open research tools, add minor features, and create expensive "Enterprise Editions" that price out independent researchers.

5. **Forces an ethical choice** - Companies must choose: use freely and contribute improvements (ethical) or attempt to monetize and gatekeep (unethical, prohibited). This filters for ethical actors.

**The strategic insight:** Commercial resources validate and improve the tool, but only if improvements remain in the commons. This license harnesses commercial capability for public benefit while preventing commercial capture.

### Why This Prevents the "Chain Effect"

If AI-collaborative tools could be monetized:

1. Individual masters cross-AI collaboration (low barrier)
2. Individual creates dozens of tools rapidly (AI acceleration)
3. Individual paywalls all tools (monetization incentive)
4. Others replicate this strategy (chain reaction)
5. AI-tool ecosystem becomes paywalled (tragedy of the commons)
6. Independent researchers locked out (gatekeeping institutionalized)

By establishing the norm NOW that AI-assisted tools should not be monetized, this license prevents that future. If the original creator (who has the most credible claim to monetize) chooses to keep the tool free, it sets a powerful precedent that others should follow.

### Why Not Traditional Open Source (MIT/Apache)?

Traditional permissive licenses (MIT, Apache, BSD) allow unrestricted commercialization. This would permit:
- Creating proprietary paid versions
- Institutional paywalls
- Commercial tool vendors charging for access
- Gatekeeping of research infrastructure

These outcomes contradict the democratization mission of this project.

### Why Not GPL?

GPL requires derivative code to be open-source but DOES allow commercial sale of the software itself. Companies could:
- Sell GPL-licensed software for profit
- Charge for "support" as a proxy for software cost
- Create commercial distributions

The non-monetization clause prevents this entirely.

### Why Not CC BY-NC (Creative Commons Non-Commercial)?

CC BY-NC prohibits ALL commercial use, including:
- Using the Software in commercial research
- Using the Software in for-profit institutions
- Using the Software in any business context

This is too restrictive. This license permits commercial USE but prohibits commercial SALE.

---

## Enforcement

Violations of this license (particularly monetization) will result in:
1. Public documentation of violation
2. Request for compliance or discontinuation
3. Community notification
4. Legal action if necessary (though unlikely)

The copyright holder prioritizes community norms and transparent communication over litigation.

## Updates and Versioning

This license is versioned (currently v1.0). Future versions may:
- Clarify ambiguities
- Add examples
- Refine non-monetization test
- Respond to community feedback

Modified versions of this license must be clearly marked as derivative licenses.
